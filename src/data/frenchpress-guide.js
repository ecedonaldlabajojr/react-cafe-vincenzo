    content: "Gently remove your French press from the scale and place it on your counter. Press the filter down. If it’s hard to press, that means your grind is too fine; if the plunger “thunks” immediately down to the floor, it means your grind is too coarse. The sweet spot, pressure-wise, is 15–20 pounds. When you’ve finished pressing, serve the coffee immediately. Don’t let it sit as this will cause it to continue brewing and over-extract."
