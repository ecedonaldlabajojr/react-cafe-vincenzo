Reduce the heat so the water is hot but not simmering or boiling. You shouldn’t be able to see any steam coming out of the percolator. For electric percolators, plug the unit in and heat the water following the manufacturer’s directions."

Some grounds may make their way into the coffee, and this resting period gives them the opportunity to settle to the bottom of the percolator."
